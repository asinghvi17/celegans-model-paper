  abstract = {Using the examples of an excitable chemical system (the Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky medium) and plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum we show that universal computation in a geometrically unconstrained medium is only possible when resources (excitability or concentration of nutrients) are limited. In situations of limited resources the systems studied develop traveling localizations. These localizations are the elementary units of dynamical logical circuits in collision-based computing architectures.},

  abstract = {Comparisons of rhythmic movements and the central pattern generators (CPGs) that control them uncover principles about the evolution of behaviour and neural circuits. Over the course of evolutionary history, gradual evolution of behaviours and their neural circuitry within any lineage of animals has been a predominant occurrence. Small changes in gene regulation can lead to divergence of circuit organization and corresponding changes in behaviour. However, some behavioural divergence has resulted from large-scale rewiring of the neural network. Divergence of CPG circuits has also occurred without a corresponding change in behaviour. When analogous rhythmic behaviours have evolved independently, it has generally been with different neural mechanisms. Repeated evolution of particular rhythmic behaviours has occurred within some lineages due to parallel evolution or latent CPGs. Particular motor pattern generating mechanisms have also evolved independently in separate lineages. The evolution of CPGs and rhythmic behaviours shows that although most behaviours and neural circuits are highly conserved, the nature of the behaviour does not dictate the neural mechanism and that the presence of homologous neural components does not determine the behaviour. This suggests that although behaviour is generated by neural circuits, natural selection can act separately on these two levels of biological organization.},

Current experiments have focused on two possibilities: pacemaker neurons and stretch-receptor feedback. Here, we focus on whether locomotion behavior can be produced by a chain of network oscillators in the ventral nerve cord. We use a simulation model to demonstrate that a repeating neural circuit identified in the wormâ€™s connectome can be chained together to drive forward locomotion on agar in a neuromechanical model of the nematode, in the absence of pacemaker neurons or stretch-receptor feedback. Systematic exploration of the space of possible solutions reveals that there are multiple configurations that result in locomotion that match the kinematics of the worm on agar. Analysis of the best solutions reveals that gap junctions between different classes of motoneurons are likely to play key roles in coordinating oscillations along the ventral nerve cord.},

In the               Caenorhabditis elegans               nervous system, descending AVB premotor interneurons exclusively form gap junctions with the B-type motor neurons that execute forward locomotion. We combined genetic analysis, optogenetic manipulation, calcium imaging, and computational modeling to elucidate the function of AVB-B gap junctions during forward locomotion. First, we found that some B-type motor neurons generate rhythmic activity, constituting distributed oscillators. Second, AVB premotor interneurons use their electric inputs to drive bifurcation of B-type motor neuron dynamics, triggering their transition from stationary to oscillatory activity. Third, proprioceptive couplings between neighboring B-type motor neurons entrain the frequency of body oscillators, forcing coherent bending wave propagation. Despite substantial anatomical differences between the motor circuits of               C. elegans               and higher model organisms, converging principles govern coordinated locomotion.},
